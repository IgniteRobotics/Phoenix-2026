Rules for any AI tool working in this FRC 6829 Ignite Robotics repo. Read every session.
Keep it short; the standards live on the site, not here.

## This repo

<!-- repo-specific:start -->
Phoenix-2026: the 2026 Phoenix robot code (Java 17, WPILib/GradleRIO 2026.2.1, `frc.robot`).

- Build and check: `JAVA_HOME=~/wpilib/2026/jdk ./gradlew build` (CI runs the same).
- Format: `./gradlew spotlessCheck`; fix with `./gradlew spotlessApply` (google-java-format).
- Simulate: `./gradlew simulateJava`. Tests (`./gradlew test`) live under `src/test/`.

## Who writes the spec

The person who owns the change writes the spec unless they have completed M8 or are a mentor. If you don't know which, ask before drafting.

Mentors and post-M8 students: propose, draft, and plan freely. Everyone else: explain, review, and
answer questions; the student writes the spec.

## Rules

- Every change starts from an issue. Branch `feature/<num>-<name>`; the PR says `Closes #<num>`.
  `openspec archive` is the PR's last commit.
- Once implementation starts, nothing edits files under `src/test/`. Not you, not the student.
  If a test looks wrong, stop and tell a mentor.
- Never run `openspec init` or `openspec update` here. They rewrite committed tool files based on
  the runner's personal settings. Tool files change only through `node .ignite/openspec-regen.mjs`
  (mentors only); CI checks for drift.
- Hooks in `.ignite/hooks/` enforce the test rule. Do not work around a block; report it to a mentor.
- Follow the AI-use tiers in the AI use standard linked below, and fill in the PR's AI disclosure honestly.
